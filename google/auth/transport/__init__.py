"""Transport - HTTP client library support.

:mod:`google.auth` is designed to work with various HTTP client libraries such
as urllib3 and requests. In order to work across these libraries with different
interfaces some abstraction is needed.

This module provides two interfaces that are implemented by transport adapters
to support HTTP libraries. :class:`Request` defines the interface expected by
:mod:`google.auth` to make requests. :class:`Response` defines the interface
for the return value of :class:`Request`.
